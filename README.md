# Simple Python Inventory & Shop System
A procedural logic-based inventory system built to practice data structures and state management in Python.

## 🚀 Features
* **Inventory Control:** Manage a list of items with a strict capacity limit of 5 slots.
* **Economic Logic:** Dedicated functions for buying and selling items with real-time balance updates.
* **Basic Persistence:** Ability to export the current session data into a `savegame.json` file.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Storage:** JSON (for state exports)

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Run the script:** `python your_filename.py`
2. **Commands:** Follow the prompts to `kaufen` (buy), `verkaufen` (sell), `anzeigen` (show status), or `ausgeben` (save to file).
3. **Save Game:** If you choose `ausgeben`, your progress is saved to `savegame.json`.

## 🎯 Learning Progress
This project was a key milestone in learning how to manage global states and complex conditional logic (`if/elif/else`). It served as the foundation for my later transition into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), showing my progression from procedural scripts to scalable software architecture.
